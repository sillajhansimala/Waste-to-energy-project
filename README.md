# Waste-to-Energy (WTE) Project – EMGT 5320 / SYSE 5105

📅 Spring 2025  
🏫 Missouri University of Science and Technology    

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the use of Waste-to-Energy (WTE) systems as a sustainable solution to address two growing urban challenges: excessive municipal waste and increasing energy demand. By converting waste into usable electricity, WTE reduces landfill dependency and supports clean energy goals.

## 🧩 Scope
- Feasibility and technical analysis of a municipal WTE plant  
- Plant design with a processing capacity of 200 tons/day  
- Total estimated cost: $391,771  
- Regulatory compliance with EPA standards  
- Risk assessment, quality control, and budgeting  
- Project timeline planning with WBS, Gantt Chart, and Critical Path  

## 📂 Contents
This repository includes the following files and folders:

- `GroupD_EMGT5320_Final project.pptx` – Final team presentation
- `Work Breakdown Structure` – WBS diagram and breakdown
- `Project Network Diagram` – Visual sequence of tasks and dependencies
- `Gantt Chart` – Timeline and scheduling of project tasks
- `Cost Estimation` – Budget and cost analysis
- `Resource Loading & Risk Mitigation` – Resource allocation and risk planning
- `images/` – Images used in the presentation  
  └── `qr-codes/` – QR code images for:
    - Gantt Chart  
    - Project Cost Estimate  
    - Project Network Diagram  

🔗 We used QR codes in the presentation to provide high-resolution access to complex visuals such as Gantt charts and network diagrams.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Early outsourcing prevents scheduling delays and improves quality  
- Regulatory planning must begin at project initiation  
- Iterative design review improves long-term success  
- Effective communication ensures smooth teamwork and execution  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Microsoft PowerPoint (Presentation)  
- Microsoft Excel (Budget and Tracking)
- Lucidchart 
- **Microsoft Project** (WBS, Gantt Chart, Network Diagram)  

## 🌍 Outcome
This project demonstrates that WTE systems are more than just a technical innovation—they are a smart, eco-friendly solution for waste management and renewable energy generation. Our proposed approach supports the goals of a circular economy and sustainable urban development.
